You can utilize the script through API commands or by relying on token collisions to provide a more interactive map for your players. Use <b>!nav help</b> in game to bring up a help dialog with details on using all the scripts features. Use !nav config to setup Page Navigator according to your preferences. If you were using a previous version of Page Navigator, the player page tag has changed to <b>.players</b> due to how variables interact with strings.",
